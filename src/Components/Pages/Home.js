	            Growing up, I've always been fancinated by computers and wanted to 
                 create my own application in the future. I was never the smartest 
                kid in the room, but I try to be as observant as possible to notice 
                the little details. Entering high school, I knew I wanted to be 
                involved somewhere in the computer science field and I decided to 
                go with software development. That was my goal in highschool, to 
                get accepted into a university for a software related program 
                because everything is going to involve software somehow and also, 
                because I want to create my own application.

                        This is just a start, I am going to continue to improve this as much as I can.
